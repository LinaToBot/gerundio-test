# Gereundio Test

This is a Landing Page project for the Frontend position at Gerundio, optimized from mobile to desktop.

The architecture used in this project is Component-based Architecture, which enables component reusability, easier maintainability with small and modular components, and scalability. The latter allows for adding new components without affecting the project structure.

The use of Hooks is to encapsulate the logic, allowing for reusability throughout the app and easier scalability.

Finally, the use of SCSS enables the use of variables, mixins, and nesting, making styles more scalable and maintainable.

## Technologies

About this project, I decided to use the following technologies:

- Node v18.18.0: It's a JavaScript runtime environment used to execute JavaScript code and install dependencies.

- npm v9.8.1: It's the Node package manager used to install libraries, manage dependencies, and run scripts.

- React ^19.0.0: I chose React because this project is a simple Landing Page that doesn't require route management. React's component-based architecture is ideal for this purpose.

- TypeScript ~5.7.2: Its static typing helps improve code reliability by enforcing data types in components, functions, hooks, etc.

- SASS (SCSS) ^1.86.1: I chose SCSS because it allows the use of variables, nested selectors, and inheritance. I prefer the SCSS syntax over SASS because it's more similar to regular CSS.

- ESLint ^9.21.0: To maintain clean code and analyze it according to ECMAScript standards.

- Vite ^6.2.0: It's a modern build tool that helps create a more efficient frontend app with faster setup and development experience.
